# Assignment 7: Data Differences
I want to create a demo of the web page I have been wanting to create.
 My idea of the website is a web-page where musicians from all walks of life can
get together in one platform and network with one another.
I want to combine several elements like something similar to LinkedIn, Facebook,
and Instagram, and Sonicbids. I also want a section where a musician who wants a
career in the music industry can get matched up with a career choice, and lists
 other options as well.

The users are musicians who are beginners to seasoned professionals that
perhaps are looking for a gig.

I will need a lot of Javascript data. I want to make my web-page very interactive.
I'm thinking of using Git to store data. I want the website to be visually
 aesthetic so I need to include several aspects of CSS.
I will also probably need other programs that we haven't discussed here in the lessons.

This website will help me get started on some outside elements I can use.
